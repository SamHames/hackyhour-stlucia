Come on down to the last Hacky Hour St Lucia for 2015! 

Let us help you with a problem or come and chat to us about the Brisbane Research Bazaar event [ResBaz](https://feb2016.resbaz.com/brisbane/) in 2016. 

We will be running a range of events at ResBaz, including [Software Carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org/) workshops (R and Python streams), a Triple Hacky Hour, and a Knowledge Bazaar.

Hope to see you there : 4 pm, St Lucy's cafe, Tuesday 15 December.
