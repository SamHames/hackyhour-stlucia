The next Hacky Hour at St Lucia (The University of Queensland) will be on Tuesday, 17 November, from 4-5pm.

Come down to [St Lucy's cafe](http://www.saintlucy.com.au/) and say hi.

You don't need to have a problem that needs solving - you might just want to touch base for later.

Or you might want to learn how to do something like ... start up a virtual machine on the [Australian research cloud](http://cloud.nectar.org.au/), install some software on your laptop, or find out about the next [Software Carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org/) training event or about local meetups, like [COMBINE](https://twitter.com/combine_au) for bioinformaticians. 

We look forward to meeting you.
