The next Hacky Hour at St Lucia (The University of Queensland) will be on **Tuesday, 1 December, from 4-5pm**.

Give yourself an early Christmas present by coming down to [St Lucy's cafe](http://www.saintlucy.com.au/) for a coffee with us.

You don't need to have a problem that needs solving &mdash; maybe you just want a break from your research.

Or you might want to know if anyone is working on a similar project to yours? 

Or ... find people using the same tools you are using in your research?

Perhaps you'd like to hear more about what is coming up at the Feb 1-3 [ResBaz](https://feb2016.resbaz.com/) in Brisbane next year?

If so, we are the people to ask!
