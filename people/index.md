# Belinda Weaver

I work for [QCIF](http://www.qcif.edu.au/) who manage [QRIScloud](http://www.qriscloud.org.au/), the Queensland node of the [Australian research cloud](http://cloud.nectar.org.au/). I'm a qualified [Software Carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org/) instructor and organise [bootcamps in Queensland](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/swc-qld). I am doing an MPhil in the UQ School of ITEE.

Ask me questions about:
* cloud resources you can access - data storage, virtual machines, local compute cluster
* computational resources, e.g. available HPC, getting time on [NCI](http://nci.org.au/), [FlashLite](https://www.qriscloud.org.au/services/compute), [Euramoo](https://www.qriscloud.org.au/services/compute)
* research data management
* data and publication repositories
* open access
* Software Carpentry
* Virtual labs like the [Biodiversity and Climate Change VL](http://bccvl.org.au/) or the [Genomics VL](http://genome.edu.au/)
