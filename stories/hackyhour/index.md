Research computing can be hard! It's made even worse when you don't have anyone to talk to and ask questions. Hacky Hours are here to help. We aim to bring people together to do better science.

For example:

- Do you analyse data?
- Do you write software to answer your research questions, but don't have any formal training?
- Having trouble installing software you need?
- Heard about a useful tool like Git for version control, but don't know where to begin?
- Don't know how to manage your data?
- Need more computational resources and don't know where to start?
- Do you feel like there's got to be a better way?

If any of these apply, Hacky Hour is for you. Bring yourself, bring your problems, bring a laptop, bring your knowledge and experience. Maybe we can figure it all out together, or at least get you going in the right direction. (And if you know the answers to some of those questions, maybe you can help others too!)

If nothing else there is coffee.
